        <description>&lt;img src="https://example.com/p/first-post/kean-first-post.jpg" alt="Featured image of post First Post" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first official post on my new blog! In this blog I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about data projects that I develop on my free time, and some of the techniques that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over my professional career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little about me: I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist that loves to write code, I love writing in R but focus mainly on python for my professional work. I love playing basketball, not actually a real hard-core NBA fan, but I might start getting more interested in the league to do some fantasy league analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also a big League of Legends fan, haven&amp;rsquo;t really played much since graduating from university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope that anyone that reads find some interesting material.&lt;/p&gt;
