[{"content":"Hello world!\nThis is the first official post on my new blog! In this blog I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about data projects that I develop on my free time, and some of the techniques that I\u0026rsquo;ve learned over my professional career.\nA little about me: I\u0026rsquo;m a data scientist that loves to write code, I love writing in R but focus mainly on python for my professional work. I love playing basketball, not actually a real hard-core NBA fan, but I might start getting more interested in the league to do some fantasy league analysis.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also a big League of Legends fan, haven\u0026rsquo;t really played much since graduating from university.\nHope that anyone that reads find some interesting material.\n","date":"2021-07-20T00:00:00Z","image":"https://example.com/p/first-post/kean-first-post_hue776a334b902d7828bf5c7a8aa11ccb3_204238_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://example.com/p/first-post/","title":"First Post"}]
