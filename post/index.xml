      <description>Hello world!
This is the first official post on my new blog! In this blog I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about data projects that I develop on my free time, and some of the techniques that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over my professional career.
A little about me: I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist that loves to write code, I love writing in R but focus mainly on python for my professional work. I love playing basketball, not actually a real hard-core NBA fan, but I might start getting more interested in the league to do some fantasy league analysis.</description>
